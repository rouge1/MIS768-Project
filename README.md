# MIS768-Project
Greetings,
This is a project for MIS768 @ UNLV. We are using the World Wind Java SDK to visualize crash data

Background and Business Case

Bicyclists and pedestrians are a class of vulnerable road users that are often overrepresented in fatal or incapacitating injury crash statistics. While passenger car fatalities have shown sharp declines in the last decade, pedestrian and bike fatalities have remained relatively constant. Although Department of Transportation (DOT) agencies have extensive road safety audit programs that utilize criteria based on the ratio of crashes to average daily traffic, DOT programs do not target locations with a high number of bike/pedestrian crashes since bicycle and pedestrian counts are not recorded. Agencies face the current challenge of allocating funds and resources equitably among urban and rural areas when designing and planning communities to maximize bicycle and pedestrian safety, thereby safeguarding the lives of the valuable citizenry.

Scope of the project:
The objective of this project is to develop a software tool (both desktop & web tool) that can be utilized to identify locations that are prone to high bicycle and pedestrian crashes also known as “hot spots.” In addition, the tool can be used to predict an approximation of crashes in a given location based on certain conditions like roadway, socio-economic status, demographic factors, etc..

The World Wind Java SDK provides a starting point for developing a NASA World Wind-enabled application for an Eclipse-based environment.
